# mpv-listenbrainz-windows
A Windows script to submit mpv listens to ListenBrainz

**FULL DISCLOSURE:** I have used an LLM to help make this script. If you are not okay with using LLM-written code, feel free to ignore this and carry on. I will probably go back and fix this up when I get better at this.

This script was originally made by Alexandre Rousseau (madeindjs) [[link](https://gist.github.com/madeindjs/f33225cf4d8fdc9f61e0fe3ebe2dcce7)]. I have retooled it in order to make it work on Windows

To download the file, go to [the file](/blob/main/mpv-listenbrainz.js) and click on the download button.

Then, put it in the mpv \scripts folder. This will either be at "%APPDATA%\mpv\scripts\" or "\apps\mpv\current\portable_config\scripts" if you are using [scoop](scoop.sh) (**NOTE:** You will have to make the folder if its not there)
